# Task

- Given a master data file, I needed to clean the given data, perform analysis on the data and ultimately visualize the data
and deploy it on a live site.

- Despite the data being static, I needed to give it a "real-time-updating" feel. This means that I had to simulate 3 major
components of Big Data to provide it with the desired feel. I had to replicate the 3 Vs: Velocity, Volume & Variety.

- Unfortunately, the current file structure is less than optimal, the code base organization is poor and there is hardly any
documentation. Taking away from this project, I've learnt the importance of long term planning, code base organization & documentation.
In the future, I will be making sure to keep these components in mind when developing.
